# Kikay Model Conversion Summary

## What We've Done
1. Successfully downloaded the H5 model files from the GitHub repository:
   - `mobilenet_skintone_final.h5` (26.93 MB)
   - `mobilenet_undertone_final.h5` (26.93 MB)

2. Analyzed the model files and created detailed information about their structure

3. Created clear instructions for converting these models to TensorFlow Lite format

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Google Colab (Recommended - No Installation Required)
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/
2. Create a new notebook
3. Upload the following files from the `models` directory:
   - `mobilenet_skintone_final.h5`
   - `mobilenet_undertone_final.h5`
4. Run the conversion code provided in `conversion_instructions.txt`
5. Download the resulting TFLite files:
   - `skintone_model.tflite`
   - `undertone_model.tflite`

### Option 2: Use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
1. Install WSL: `wsl --install` in PowerShell (restart your computer if needed)
2. Install Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store
3. In Ubuntu terminal:
   ```bash
   # Install Python and pip
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   
   # Install TensorFlow
   pip3 install tensorflow
   
   # Copy the H5 files to your Linux home directory
   # Run the conversion script
   ```

### Option 3: Use Docker (If You Have Docker Installed)
1. Create a Dockerfile or use a TensorFlow Docker image
2. Mount the models directory
3. Run the conversion inside the container

## After Conversion
Once you have the TFLite models, you can integrate them into your Flutter app by:
1. Adding the `tflite_flutter` package to your `pubspec.yaml`
2. Creating a service to load and run the models
3. Replacing the hardcoded values in your app with actual model predictions

## Model Information
- Both models are based on MobileNetV2 architecture
- They have 376 datasets and 117 groups
- The models are approximately 27 MB each
- They are designed for skin tone (3 classes) and undertone (3 classes) classification
