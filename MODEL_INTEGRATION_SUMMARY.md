# Model Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of TensorFlow Lite models for skin tone and undertone detection in the Kikay app.

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `lib/services/model_service.dart` - Main model service implementation
2. `lib/services/model_test.dart` - Testing utilities
3. `test_model_integration.dart` - Integration test script
4. `MODEL_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Detailed implementation documentation
5. `MODEL_INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `pubspec.yaml` - Added tflite_flutter dependency and asset declarations
2. `lib/main.dart` - Added model service initialization
3. `lib/routes.dart` - Updated routing to pass model service
4. `lib/screens/output.dart` - Updated to use model predictions
5. `lib/screens/preferences.dart` - Updated to remove hardcoded values

## Implementation Details

### Model Service
The `ModelService` class handles:
- Loading TFLite models from assets
- Preprocessing images for model input
- Running predictions on skin tone and undertone models
- Converting model outputs to human-readable labels
- Resource management (disposing interpreters)

### Data Flow
1. App initializes ModelService in main.dart
2. ModelService loads both TFLite models at startup
3. User captures/selects an image through the camera flow
4. Image path is passed through navigation: camera → result → preferences → output
5. Output screen receives the image path and ModelService
6. Output screen runs predictions when loaded
7. Results are displayed to the user

### Model Information
- **Skin Tone Model**: `assets/mobilenet_skintone_final.tflite`
  - 6-class classification: Fair, Light, Medium, Olive, Brown, Dark
- **Undertone Model**: `assets/mobilenet_undertone_final.tflite`
  - 3-class classification: Cool, Warm, Neutral

### Image Preprocessing
1. Load image file as bytes
2. Decode using image package
3. Resize to 224x224 pixels (MobileNet input size)
4. Extract RGB values and normalize to [0, 1] range
5. Convert to Float32List for model input

## Dependencies Added
- `tflite_flutter: ^0.10.4` - For running TFLite models
- `image: ^4.0.17` - For image preprocessing

## Testing
The implementation includes:
- Model loading verification
- Error handling for missing models
- Error handling for image processing failures
- Resource cleanup (disposing interpreters)

## Performance Considerations
- Models loaded once at app startup
- Interpreters reused for multiple predictions
- Asynchronous prediction to avoid blocking UI
- Proper resource management

## Next Steps
1. Test with actual images to verify predictions
2. Add error handling for prediction failures
3. Implement caching for processed images
4. Add model accuracy metrics
5. Optimize image preprocessing if needed
