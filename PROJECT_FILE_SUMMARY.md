# Project File Summary

This document provides an overview of all files created to support the TensorFlow Lite model conversion and Flutter integration process.

## Documentation Files

1. **TFLITE_CONVERSION_GUIDE.md**
   - Comprehensive guide for converting H5 models to TFLite format
   - Covers all three conversion methods (Google Colab, Docker, Linux/WSL)

2. **MODEL_CONVERSION_README.md**
   - Detailed technical documentation about the conversion process
   - Explains why TFLite is beneficial for mobile deployment

3. **FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md**
   - Complete guide for integrating TFLite models into Flutter app
   - Includes code examples and implementation details

4. **CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md**
   - Summary of all created files and next steps

5. **conversion_instructions.txt**
   - Quick reference for conversion process

## Conversion Scripts

1. **convert_models.py**
   - Python script to convert H5 models to TFLite format
   - Handles both skintone and undertone models

2. **test_model_conversion.py**
   - Script to verify models can be loaded and converted
   - Useful for troubleshooting

3. **Dockerfile**
   - Docker configuration for TensorFlow environment
   - Enables conversion without installing TensorFlow locally

## Automation Scripts

1. **upload_to_colab.bat**
   - Windows batch script with Google Colab instructions
   - Helps with uploading files and running conversion code

2. **check_docker.ps1**
   - PowerShell script to verify Docker installation
   - Checks if Docker is properly configured

3. **convert_with_docker.ps1**
   - Automated PowerShell script for Docker-based conversion
   - Handles the entire process from build to conversion

## Model Files

1. **models/mobilenet_skintone_final.h5**
   - Skin tone detection model (26.93 MB)
   - MobileNetV2 architecture

2. **models/mobilenet_undertone_final.h5**
   - Undertone detection model (26.93 MB)
   - MobileNetV2 architecture

## Expected Output Files

After successful conversion:
1. **models/skintone_model.tflite**
2. **models/undertone_model.tflite**

## Integration Files (To be created)

For Flutter integration:
1. **lib/services/model_service.dart** (described in FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
2. Updated **pubspec.yaml** with tflite_flutter dependency and asset declarations

## Usage Workflow

1. **Choose conversion method** based on your environment:
   - Google Colab (Windows users with internet access)
   - Docker (Users wanting local conversion)
   - Linux/WSL (Users with Linux environment)

2. **Run conversion** using the appropriate method

3. **Verify output** by checking that TFLite files were created

4. **Integrate into Flutter** by following FLUTTER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

5. **Test implementation** with sample images

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all required files are present
2. Verify Docker installation (for Docker method)
3. Ensure internet connectivity (for Google Colab method)
4. Confirm sufficient disk space and memory
5. Refer to the detailed documentation files for specific error solutions
